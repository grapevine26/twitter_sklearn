Wenger's players or not we had enough to get top four. Emery failed to implement both Ramsey and √ñzil often enough in the same team and the time we did see it (vs Napoli) we gave our best performance of the season, with what was a great first half. Not to forget we had the best..

Awesome!! Keep up the fight in the once great state of CA.
we were being to each other, to him, to the latest film or show that most of us hadn't yet come to terms with & accepted yet. (e.g., Ahsoka Tano) What was important was that THE DIALOGUE CONTINUED. He never engaged us, initiated STAN groups nor pulled OPS to control a narrative.

I like that the artist paired "abortion" with three sexual activities that will definitely NOT lead to an abortion.
I'm gonna be honest, hearing this "men are trash" rhetoric for the 100th time over will either level your mental state if it's at all healthy, or enrage you to the point where deleting Twitter is your best option.

Truthfully I believe we in humanity know not enough about the human mind or sexuality to say either way, but what two people do in private, really has nothing to do with anyone else! I think as well there is a very rampant cloaked homophobia even today!

You, of all people, should appreciate his efforts at interpretive ‚ÄútRUMP‚Äù speak. He did exactly what you do, day in & day out. He took a small snippet of truth & made it into a fable... right before your very eyes. Of course, we all understood the sarcasm. You heard your self!
Ilhan is a great local example of this, she came to this country not speaking a word of english, graduated from college less than a decade later, and worked her way into politics from the bottom. She supports the policies she does because she knows how they would have helped her
If you consider civil war an option, you‚Äôre not a patriot, but a traitor. If you consider it okay to act like children and not reach compromise to make a better nation, you‚Äôre a true enemy of the Constitution. If you believe Trump is innocent, then let investigation clear him.

Let's hope the Republicans decide to go back to their hoary "traditional values" of honesty, truth, respect for the rule of law and the practice of boy scout goodness. They've been so happy to worship Trump, maybe they'll realize he's a toxic clay idol.

Well, if you go to simple tax dot ca, and you fill out a tax return for 2015 and one for 2018, and just fill in some name and then the same amount of income for both years, you will see on page 4 what the federal tax amount is. If you earned 100,000 it is over $1000 less in 2018.

Ah yes Breitbart, the pinnacle of balanced American journalism.
It‚Äôs not possible though with the cap. It‚Äôs one or the other if you plan on keeping Ovi after next year. Without Backstrom you lose the center depth, your best defensive forward, your best PP QB, a very good PKer, much more to lose there than a good goalie in my opinion.

I very much understand the frustration of having people with this much wealth speaking in this way. On the other hand I think it‚Äôs toxic to say ‚Äúno you‚Äù. Many effective advocates for change throughout human history started with no wealth, Greta is a great example.

"The result, with Trump gone and the leftists too scattered and bickering to form any coherent front, was a new golden age of technological innovation, prosperity, US power, and peace."

My rep,  is in this same boat: He *for sure* hasn't read the WH summary of this call just like he didn't read the Mueller Report. Why? Bc he takes his orders (and talking points) from the White House. He has forgotten his constituency. He must be voted out #NE02
When the Founding Fathers gave the ability to impeach to the House, they never counted on there being enough corrupt politicians in 1 Party for it to be corrupted into a political tool to undo the vote of The People just because they did not like the result.

True. Spending years putting your finger on the pulse of truth, then turning the corner & realizing that was a lie too, is challenging beyond comprehension. Makes one want to be a deep sleeper, if not diligent enough to keep digging.

not making a judgement on that, but I do think people being even remotely hopeful about Barr's investigation are just as naive as Democrats who were hopeful about Muellers. We need to face reality that real corruption at the highest levels will never face serious consequences
I have been back and forth about getting Invisalign. I do love the gap in my teeth but unfortunately it's making my back teeth really tight and hard to clean in between so I have decided to do so and I'm sure I'm‚Ä¶
Some agents already pay College Athletes. Will this help the athletes maybe! Will this invite other issues for NCAA players? Will schools that have bigger donors get more players? Is competitive balance dead?

My whole life I used to dread Mondays... until I started a job that lets me see how excited kids get when they pass a test on that designated day of the week that they‚Äôve worked so hard at. Also, even high school kids dig stickers. Their smiles are priceless.
Things that reminded me of home appeared in the area too. Things from my past. Ever since then I just loved Colossus to death and became so attached. I saw that place as my second home- a place I could escape to. It felt welcoming and I felt like I belonged.

Agreed on last point, wch is why I only focused on vols 1 & 4, 1968 & 1975 (tho' I think vol 3 is also similar in its politics). As I've said, I've seen people recommend the CHI to non-specialists wanting to learn about Iran. It's available online. It was written by top scholars.

Now "regulating" means allowing scammers to take money out of the people, then going there and taking part of the money from scammers, never giving anything back to the scammed. In common language that has another name, which I don't recall right now. Is that what you support?

Dear barista thank you for not looking me in the face while I‚Äôm trying to order a chai latte bc like Medusa if you look at a cripple they will turn you into stone. You are so well educated.
That‚Äôs why I watch most of the leagues games twice each weekend. You find the truth in there somewhere , not following the ball around. I wish I had somebody really good at it to teach me how to be more efficient at watching games back.

Why do some men want to get rid of women‚Äôs sports? I don‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôs been so simple to base teams on biology at birth. And the biology is clear.

Also be prepared to have smoking dreams but less and less frequently. In your dreams the cigarette will taste better than it ever did! Smelling ‚Äúyour brand‚Äù in the air will cause a pang for a while too. That‚Äôs 1 reason why former smokers don‚Äôt want smoke in the air near them
If our Attorney General Barr has been holding private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials to get help to discredit the conclusion of the United States intelligence agencies‚Äô investigation of Russian interference in our 2016 election, he is a treasonous traitor!

In practice it depersonalises your working space, prevents you keeping useful additional resources near you, makes it hard for colleagues to find you, messes with the ergnomics of you seating and monitor position. I‚Äôve never found anyone who likes it.

Prior to Trump the GOP enforced strict rules about toeing the party line. This is why they don't put country before party. Trump is the logical result.

The Mueller investigation was focused on Trump. They didn‚Äôt appear to pursue the origins of the DNC/MSM hoax. Or the foreign countries/spies that played a roll. But I sure want to know. If there were crimes, they should be pursued vigorously.

Many schools may. This particular school, tho? Not so sure. Remember, this is the private 'Christian' school where FLOTUS#2, Mrs. Pence teaches, part time. Pretty sure their curriculum is CLOSELY monitored for 'fault'. The MSM would be all over it, like fly's on a TURD if so.

Pickford; James, Tomori, Mings, Chilwell; Winks, Henderson; Sancho, Sterling, Hudson-Odoi; Kane. That eleven would have every chance of winning the euros. Sacrifice Hudson-Odoi for Maddison if you want to fill the midfield out in a more competitive game

Costco opening was great but people started to cancel membership after 2-3 days. Different than in the U.S., Costco China sells a lot more high-price items (luxury bags, Maotai, PC, iPhones, etc). They secured some of the above at a lower price but now the price is normalized...

Just gonna slip this in to the feed. I trust her and all the profits are going to the Whistleblower‚Äôs legal fund. And the design came from someone you know and love.
People are saying, Acosta let‚Äôs hope Trump doesn‚Äôt get to know who the whistleblower is because something will happen like Epstein, he was in jail lock up on Watch every 10-15 minutes there no place to hang yourself & somehow Epstein ended up dead, Was it for trumps interest???

Well Trump appointed the head of Radio Free Europe! There are many more articles such as The WSJ on day it broke. If you actually care for the truth.
Pretty sure the answer is about as disgusting as the rest of this mess: profits. It was obvious from the '16 primaries that Trump in office would be a perpetual revenue stream. Don't think they even considered a chance of consequences
Change begins with us, let's make a change by shunning enemity among us and embrace peace and love. It will make the world a better place. Wise words sis. Happy independence day.

What veneer. Barr's been a crook since he tried out for the role. Pompeo is a pompous ass, eho enjoys judging and laughing at others. And Trump has been a wanna be B side celebrity with mafia ties and no sense his whole life. These people are barely viable.

As for Trump; considering he's sold our country out for favors to get elected again, I suggest he officially change his last name from TRUMP to TRUMPSKY and so should his 3 oldest kids, since he and they seem to be loyal only to Putin and NOT to the United States.

I am not so sure. Narcissism could win out here. And I am not so sure about the family either. Donny would sell out those kids to save himself without hesitation.

I would keep Mickey. I know it's not the popular choice amongst my fellow Met fans, but let's consider the fact he hasn't had a full season from Cespedes in two years and a shaky bullpen at best. Does he make questionable in-game decisions? Yes he does but this team never quit

You stunk it up on the show trying to defend Trump. Has Trump driven you to drink? Sure did look and sound like you knocked back a few before this interview. You were having trouble saying simple words. A friendly suggestion, take a nice Vacay in rehab until Trump is history.

The sudden swing of the pendulum from not caring about representation in Hollywood to all of the sudden making it the most important thing there is in cinema is fascinating. I would typically recommend a film to prioritize quality of acting as opposed to simply representation.

I appreciate it, but that's about as soft a statement as one could give. Very committed on it, weren't they? Was it Flake's aide who said this or Susan Collins's aide? I'd guess Flake's. If it were Collins's, they would have used the word 'concerned.'

Which means South Dakota gets one EC vote per 294,000 people. CA gets one per 720,000. South Dakotans literally get twice as much representation. The only reason to keep it is because it‚Äôs the only way republicans have been able to win in the last ~20 yrs

Deep state has gained momentum w/impeachment drive. What negates that is a release by AG Barr of information he is in possession of to the public. Headlines will preempt Dems expropriation of the media & focus on the true criminality in our midst.

Any person who is open minded, analytical,logical,fair,reasonable etc can both support them and criticize/question them, or simply share frustration about them. I think most here think that way even when it may not appear that way. Most everyone is working toward the same goal.

This is what Fox "news" is holding up as proof trump is innocent... They are calling the fact that trump commits crimes in the open "above board". Well yeah your honor, my client did kill 1000 people, but he said he was going to do it beforehand, so its all above board.

Sounds like an out with the "corrupt" one to get "our" guy in to "investigate" ... we know how this happens on both sides. Looks like the investigation is being reopened ... where there is smoke there is fire.
Instead of all this hoopla, let's have a referendum election to vote on whether or not to proceed with the impeachment and if it's a win, inquiry proceeds unto vote on floor of Congress. If not all lawmakers who pushed for it forfeit their seats and allow for special elections
I am absolutely never going to watch it, but I'm not even sure what the argument would be. "Vote for Republicans, we're going to be honest and destroy the planet on purpose". "Vote for whoever has the most ambitious climate plan". I mean, it's definitely neither of those

The winner of the primary isn‚Äôt going to get in the high-20s. Folks will either shift to warren or Biden (possibly Bernie or Pete, but unlikely) soon. I bet one of them will be polling in the 40s by November.
are you talking about the star of Bethlehem falling to earth??? what?? of course the people of that time thought the huge looking "star" was unusual. but I'm thinking of Josephus (secular historian of that time) and one other one. I will research and see if they recorded it.
Jeremiah 17:7 Blessed are those who trust in the Lord and have made the Lord their hope and confidence.

SARS is a state agency. The idea that its immune from scrutiny by IGI is simply bizzare. The minister mandated IGI to look into allegations so that should also assist you.

The Islanders do not play a defensive system. It's a defensively responsible system that creates chances on quick transitions and a heavy forecheck. I can't tell if you are serious about Eberle but he is a second line wing on any other team. Barzal needs a true sniper.
When the Bible says "watch and pray" it doesn't mean "watch and criticize," "watch and gossip" or "watch and judge."

Just awesome. Such great leaders in radiology! I‚Äôve noticed the problem of sub-specializing at the trainee level, where residents say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going into IR, neuro, MSK‚Äù so the rotation isn‚Äôt taken as serious as it could be. General Radiologist = The Great Synthesizer of data!
I surprisingly liked Daredevil. But I'm not surprised other people aren't big fans of it. But the comments are totally trying to be edgy with the Zico comments that it's actually kinda funny to read. Netizenbuzz and Pannchoa commenters will be the same.
Actually, it sounds kind of close to something I used to have when I was really little that always made me feel better.

Rudy Giuliani wanted to be Secretary of State, and Trump chose someone else. Doing Trump's bidding in Ukraine was Rudy's way of pretending to play the role he always wanted. The corruption was immaterial to him, and now he'll face the music.
Thanks for the intel! Will order this week. Love his animation.
Now isnt that special, Hillary calling Trump corrupt!! Thanks for the good laugh tonight.
It's not about the defence as such, it's the midfield, but they will be transformational. We need to drop Xhaka and play Torriera correctly and introduce Willock with Gwen. Now that will be a real team and tell them to express themselves

It is a great time to raise awareness of the dangers of centralized editable e-money and the decentralized alternatives like #btc #ltc and others. Remember, you can charge your NANACO card with cryptocurrency and use that to buy goods and services in most locations nationally.

Trump's VP & cabinet know he's mentally unbalanced & it is their job to use the 25th Amendment to remove him. The only recourse Pelosi has is impeachment. His family & the GOP are using him for personal gain and power. It's on them, stop gaslighting Nancy.

There are Republicans that do not support Trump. You don't need to make this about the party. This is about a president who has seemed to break the law and should be impeached. Why do Democrats want to distance themselves from the Republicans. They need the Republicans here

I didn't say anything about "should." Past comments can, and sometimes do, affect your life. The kid in the story sounds like he's grown up to be a good guy, and he's clearly very generous, and that's wonderful. That doesn't change the fact that our choices are ours.

Here's the problem with that assumption, when I was out on the streets I befriended a woman, whom had a man chasing her, but when he found out that she preferred me to men, well he just couldn't handle it,so he asked a friend of his who was an acquaintance of mine

You are correct sir. And I am guilty of that. Put on your Sunday best used to mean something. The traditions and rituals of the Jewish faith have sustained, even in the face of ridicule and persecution.

We have to find away to get us all together! Power in number a bigger voice to combat all this BS. Saw a YouTube video cant remember who (sorry) but he said they did a trade organization (UK) I guess like the VTA that could interconnect all vape shops!

#RHUB305 My person of interest for the letter writing project will be Martin Shkreli and his exclusive ownership of the Wu-Tang album, "Once Upon a Time in Shaolin." I will write a letter convincing him to release the album.
It's pretty clear that Johnson is committed to no-deal Brexit, because he's unwilling to consider any other possibility that could even plausibly get the EU's agreement. Every move has to be seen in that light. This is just one more step to enable him to say he tried everything.
Last meal in San Diego, so I hit up Phil's BBQ in the airport. I forgot how damn good it tasted!!! Achievement Unlocked: Good Ending - TwitchCon 2019

We all have the same spiritual privilege. But we do not have equal spiritual maturity. God loves every single person on Planet Earth. But that does not mean that everything we do is pleasing to Him. Spiritual maturity comes when we begin to live a life that is pleasing to Him.
I'm a Democrat and not trying to destroy anyone. Good job on the cleanup BTW you don't need to give credit to Trump you did that. Stop with all the hyperbolic talk. Trump broke the law and we're going to have a hearing. Let the process begin
hi October pls be the best month for memy last month was full of sadness and tears

Yeah, that‚Äôs what I mean. I hate seeing those BS statements. You‚Äôre right he was out coached by the best coach in the game. He admitted it. He‚Äôs learning from it.
I felt stressed, tired, feeling like Im taking on the entire world. I dated on and off but no one seemed to understand what I was dealing with and going through. I was fighting constantly with my best friend and just didnt think I was being heard.
I would not take the pills. I have the best dreams - never the same one twice, often taking place in exotic locales with incredible adventures and casts o‚Äôthousands. I would be so bereft if I had to give up the wackiness which only my subconscious can contrive.
But we‚Äôll fight back and we‚Äôll keep fighting back and in the end the people that hated Todd and 76 will be quite and calm because you can‚Äôt silence the loyalty of the Bethesda fandom so I ask of you please keep your opinions about fallout to yourself and have a nice day thank u
They r in the process of impeaching trump. It is beautiful
With all the crazy news this is a wonderful change of pace!! Thank you!!
"Kimberly" here had her acct restricted for talking about mass-murdering her fellow citizens. Why not suspend her ? I wont bother checking out her feed, but I'd bet that she also talks about "loving Jesus" and being a "patriot", just like all the hateful #MAGAts

As an addendum, I would like to add that the couple looked terrific, was very happy to see one another after months apart, and when this whole thing airs some months from now, I will undoubtedly be in the background, staring at the camera, but not really staring at the camera.

The impact of gun violence is often described as a stone being cast into a pond and the impact radiates in all directions for a great distance. The book has given me additional insights into the long term impacts of school shootings, impacts that could be easy to discount
Obviously we‚Äôre still missing the most important element (ourselves as the screaming person!) but our backgrounds look so amazing! 5th grade is doing a phenomenal job showcasing their understanding of perspective and how to show the element of space!

NO YOU JUST BLOW.. TRUMP ASKED A COUNTRY WE GIVE MILLIONS TO (NOT EXTORTION) TO SEE IF THERE WAS A FOUL.. YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE FOUL.. VERY UN-USA!!!! YOU RICH ELITIST WITH A LARGE CARBON FOOTPRINT!!
You hardly mean to demolish the beautiful, historical and architecturally important broadstone station though?! Just the bus parking lot I hope!
Update on Sublime: for her age, it appears she has arthritis on her spine hence the weight loss there. Her blood panel came back and everything was great except her kidneys. She came out an 8 when they‚Äôre supposed...
can you read your tweet again. Does it matter if he was class or does it matter if he made an error to a huge goal? What is it for you? Because for me I don‚Äôt care about what he does until the final whistle, if he shanked then he shanked...No1 remembers the teams that finish 2nd
Why not ask Trump why he doesn't ask the Russians to walk away and leave American politics alone? He's surely aware what's happening on American social media that's attributable to Russian trolls yet he says NOTHING TO PUTIN.
He didn‚Äôt delete it. She deleted the entire thread. But I‚Äôve got the receipts lol.
An excellent observation made. This is a new beginning for all 4 shows and of course they'll be some missteps along the way, but hopefully all can bring something different to the table.
So he‚Äôs a friend of yours but you are going to be objective? Yes the situation he came into is from fair to him, but his own qualities or lack there of are what costing him. The club remember seemed to think a world class manager wasn‚Äôt needed to guarantee EPL football
I'm not a huge politics guy but this is why it's hard to support the left anymore. Since Trump took office this, along with cancel culture and the intolerance of any ideas other than their own, its hard to want to support them. Growing up the left was all class. Now? Not so much.
Yeah no. 1- it is well known we originally wanted to trade picks but were only offered spuds and retirees for these top picks. As such we went with the youth policy. 2- only played kids? That's all we had. We played who we could. Its not tanking in any way shape or form.
How often do you plan to post now the challenge is over?
For everybody who knows me, knows I just got hype AF to this video!!!  is the GREATEST WWF superstar ever...EVER!!!
Damn, that sucks. Wish  all the best moving forward.
Y‚Äôall prob tired of me saying this, but don‚Äôt give up on your dreams. Literally getting paid for doing something you love is the most satisfying feeling and I want that for everyone
ok good. i understand your logic. thanks for clearing the air
I‚Äôve been there. I feel that. I‚Äôm still there some days and on some things. It‚Äôll get better tho. The first step is just to try. Even if you start by asking something small. Practice makes perfect. I believe in you
As a frugal individual I hate to admit this, but I just used our CVS extra care bucks for the first time (they always expire before I can use them) and saved nearly 50% on my shopping trip and I‚Äôve never been so happy
I can respect that but why wouldn‚Äôt they be friends after? Maybe you don‚Äôt want your friend to lose but it doesn‚Äôt seem like an either/or situation. Maybe too brutal in pro boxing. I‚Äôve only sparred friends in the gym.

This is the real conspiracy - Barr , on Trump‚Äôs orders, attempting to discredit his own Justice Dept and weaken confidence in our government. Wondering if Trump is actually a Russian asset. No other explanation is possible at this point.Imagine Putin with a very satisfied smile.

Ohh, that's very interesting! Couple questions‚Äî - Did you mean -ss 32 in the first one? - What's a .ts? - What I got when I tried this (with -ss 32) was that the video played until 35.435644 and then just froze‚Äî no movement in the video after that point. Is that surprising?

Yes, in so many words. It says they have the ability to front run clients which creates a conflict of interest. However, the company has guidance and disclosure rules that prohibits this. ‚Äî> Complete bs. Nothing can prevent them from buying shares then recommending same.

Good point about the players. I thought maybe they made it a social justice issue because of the article that had been written about it before the season started but maybe it was because some players were angry about it and that was the teams way of trying to make it better.

He didn't do very much, but he didn't do anything wrong. He flubbed the chance in front of goal, but it was a volley, and those are tough. The problem with Lucas, as I see it, is that he doesn't get open. He seems stuck behind other players half the time and rarely gets the ball.

I would say the Trump Administration is responsible for the National Debt extention recently. Obama also had to put two wars that Bush and Republican's never put on the books. They really screwed up. Obama had to put it on the record which raised the debt.

That's funny. Just last week the Dems we're saying if he/she were to get hurt it would be blood in Trump's hands. No how convenient is this? Another accidental suicide maybe. Hit by a convenient car maybe? It really would not surprise me if it happened so they could put blame.

Right, but they walk to the building and enter at the nearest door. They aren't walking along the brutal parts for too long.

Who would have thought in two short years or so with Trump being president our country is being torn apart? The #1 reason is Trump tweeting out hate every single day, calling people names and dividing the country He only represents and caters to #Maga and himself. #Resist

As for mass shootings, the only real definition given has 3 or more subjects being killed. With that definition being used, that includes gang violence. So when you add up all the shootings that have taken place like Chicago and NY, blacks actually are tops in mass shootings

Rules that uphold some semblance of uniformity in the sport (even while certain teams covertly undermine it) are in fact necessary. Writers who cover amateur sports, and turn a blind eye, only hurt the sport. Should PODs be made "legal" as well? since we know they are out there.

GUY THIS IS FAKE!!! SM are know for leaking out the demo version of their songs, they do it a lot with EXO and SNSD and besides you can only hear two voices so meaning THIS IS NOT THE ACTUAL TRACK. Please stop spreading rumors and just wait until the song comes out.
They should've also identified that the messaging in the show is incredibly muddled when it comes to any topic, and so the show never really commits to one overarching message/implication, so the real critique is "the showrunner was inept" rather than "she was a nazi"

Honestly I find it impossible to believe Norman is dead, even tho my Twitter feed is 95% about losing her. It doesn't seem real. Her memoir seemed on the secretive side, but I still think about it constantly & she lives vividly in my mind, tho of course I never met her. Immortal.

The core of Dan's position makes sense (shitty people still deserve basic human rights) but his absolute refusal to see how saying framing RMS as "just a weird guy" fundamentally misrepresents the reckoning he's facing is blowing my mind and has made me lose respect for him

He is an illegitimate President. In the end, once all the facts are uncovered and known, I believe there will be direct evidence that vote totals were manipulated to get Trump a victory. The Administration is hiding this info. Once replaced, all the dirt will pour out
Oh Ilan your words are lies and filled with hatred. What have I done for your country and the people who voted for you. That‚Äôs right nothing. Our President has done many things for our country that other Presidents wanted to do but never did. Jealousy
Furthermore, doesn‚Äôt placing it on the different, separate, special electronic server (cough cough lock her up) imply that they needed to hide/cover up the details of this conversation (and apparently others) because everyone understood it was unlawful, dangerous to have around?

Everyone experiences grief differently. The only advice I can give U is that the only way to go thru it is to go THRU it. Don't try to sidestep it or quash it. It'll just come back to haunt you. And take care of Lilith. Maybe God sent her to you to give you something to focus on.

The biggest hurdle for this assertion is that you have to go a long way from eligible voter to dem primary voter. I‚Äôve already shown that eligible voter doesn‚Äôt equal registered voter doesn‚Äôt equal actual voter. The situation is worse when it comes to who votes in a primary.
Did you look at that graphic? If you pay ¬£4,542 tax & NIC a year (I wish), ¬£40 of that goes to the EU. ¬£25 is spent on overseas aid. The remaining ¬£4,477 is spent domestically by the UK government.

Scott is definitely a Republican trying to get people to vote, so he has an agenda. So part of his strategy is showing these liberal cities that if the local govt won't clean up their cities, we private citizens will, and we're Trump supporters who get a bad rap in the media.

What do you call a person who professes their love for jerk wings, but cry literal tears at the hint of a spice. A fraud ... You are a fraud, .
Not everyone is gonna get a joke from someone they barely know. You even said yourself that you don't even remember who I am, how am I supposed to understand your sense of humor? That's the worst form of criticism I have ever read. Criticism is meant to still respect the work

Indeed. That one actually makes more sense. As he basically said no to Lakers in public after ignoring offers, rejecting meetings and looking the other way even upon chants of "We Want George" at Staples. Kawhi just bluntly opted to say 'no'. Makes sense some would be salty.

It‚Äôs embarrassing for our state how someone who voted to add more than $2 trillion to the national debt acts as though she‚Äôs not ‚ÄòWashington‚Äô. Not to mention that underfunding vital services will always result in a surplus. What misleading claptrap.
U gave no details to the damage u referenced. That makes a difference. That being said, U describe a terrible and tragic event. However that is one circumstance, however tragic, doesn't create policy on its own. Every life deserves a chance, and no one has the right to take it

It seems this effort started ( or was amplified) after the Mueller Report was first issued. Even with Barr/Rosenstein's pressure it did not absolve Trump ENOUGH in their view.
Thank you for all that you and your family have had to go through to MAGA. Democrats have done nothing but try to erase the votes of millions and erase the 2016 election because they did not like the outcome. They are corrupt. They need to be stopped at the ballot box in 2020.

NO One intends the U.S. to adopt a ‚Äòsocialist government‚Äô! Social programs, since 1944, prove to temper the imbalance between ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù & ‚Äòdemocracy‚Äô as capitalism too often pushes self-serving agendas, i.e., ‚Äúgreed, wealth-hording‚Äù and/or ‚ÄúHow much can we get away with‚Äù?

I might be missing the commentary on this, or maybe I'm wrong, but isn't it bonkers that Trump's personal lawyer has anything to do with state matters? Should he be treated as a private citizen and be kept far away from other countries' leaders/processes?
It's all coming out, swiftly. It's all coming undone, rapidly. Like in the film "Downfall", Trump is cornered and he insults our Intelligence Agencies. General Wilhelm Burgdorf: I can't permit you to insult the soldiers. Adolf Hitler: They are cowards, traitors and failures!

No-he quoted someone that said it would be a fracture like a civil war No-he said he had a right to face the accuser No-adam Schiff lied and fabricated statements, Trump said he needs to resign. Good job following the false narrative by your party and the media. #Liar
It was when Jimin mentioned that he listened to Trey Sngz. Trey is an artist that I really like in the sexy RnB genre. It was rare for him to be mentioned by other artists so i was so shocked to hear a korean idol(who i have prejudice before that were all cutesy) listen to such!

For example let's go back to the last civil war. Tim's logic, in his condemnation of Trump, would support this: "Sir, the south are getting riled up. They are talking about war." Tim: "Well let's not talk about it because if we do, war might happen."

Asking Ukraine to look into corruption IN GENERAL is fine. Asking them to look specifically at a political opponent is not. Biden (along with the IMF, EU and the entire earth) wanted that prosecutor fired BECAUSE HE WASN‚ÄôT INVESTIGATING ANYTHING.
Causing massive rifts between Americans has been #1 on the "Ultimate Useful Idiot's " agenda since taking office. Be aware though: Even if impeached, this psychotic egomaniac will not go quietly from office and will incite his "base" to do terrible things (as he has in the past).

It‚Äôs interesting how this expression of the ‚Äúone-drop rule‚Äù was used to re-enforce racism in America and the supposed ‚Äúpurity‚Äù of the white race when race in itself is a completely social construct. They used this rule as if it were based in science rather than racism.

The reason we often fail to recognize opportunities is because they come disguised as problems. When a customer, a colleague, or your boss has a problem, it may create an opportunity for you. Take the initiative to find the answer, solve the problem, or keep the project moving.

"unable" to do the job is not the same thing as "I don't like the way he's doing it". 25A is for things like medical problems, not policy disagreements. It if were, we'd either be chucking presidents every term, or -- more likely -- every cabinet would be 100% blood loyalists.

Men are not the same. Patriarchy, upheld by men (and women made to submit to them) is the cause of our problems. So those "gold diggers" you're talking about? Were told by the patriarchy that men are "supposed" to provide for them. So you all made and upheld that standard.

We have bug chasers in my area, I'm terribly afraid of them. To the point I haven't dated a guy.
Your comment is STUPID. He was NOT calling for a civil war. But he is right......the stupidness of the dems would cause a war.
They are now also charging me!! I put phones in boxes and then the return box to avoid this! What is going on?! This is ridiculous

The fact that everyone has such high expectations for her fundraising is probably not good for her (because there is a good chance she underperforms expectations)
Sorry, but this isn‚Äôt actually outrageous. The suitability of Barr‚Äôs direct involvement in the probe can certainly be argued. However, Papadopoulos‚Äô story has yet to be debunked. The role of the US intelligence apparatus in the 2016 election should absolutely be investigated.
Total bullshit. Hang her by her neck until dead. They would any of the rest of us!
VAR has brought out the inner stupid in some people. The law about refs making final decisions has been the case as long as I can remember, possibly ever since the advent of linos. Plenty of times ppl complain about replay when they're mad at the law (or their team caught out).

Parliament could have repealed the Acts at any time, indeed they were offered that exact option during the indicative votes process, but they didn't because they have no democratic mandate to do so... just like they have no democratic mandate for a 2nd referendum, dopey!

Let Negan loose! I‚Äôm watching the return of #TWD Sunday 9/8c.
Very good question. Of course, one explanation for the early roots of the #TrumpRussia investigations is that some within USIC did in fact know, or suspect. Then the Carter Page & George PapaD weirdness only raised suspicions further. And then Agent Orange fired Comey....
No, I base it on the fact they attack, dox and do everything Vincent is saying they do.
I feel like calling someone bastard is more of an insult to their parents than the actual person

The kid ‚Äúthreatening‚Äù to move in with his dad if he can‚Äôt eat meat in the house is what kinda seals the deal for me here. Mom takes control of her kid or finds another non-vegan dude for her and her son to mooch off of.
People are stupid and make mistakes when they are frantically trying to cover their butts. The declassification of the Ukranian call threw them for a loop and they thought it was a fluke. For some reason they also didn't expect the letter from Australia to be released.

Even as someone who's finished every game except 2, I think you should refrain from posting spoilers for the sake of people who haven't played some of the titles because the first 3 games especially have moments that ruin the whole experience if the end is spoiled

We have a 16yo who called her 17yo brother to tell him that she was "touched inappropriately", and he showed up and beat the guy to death. There was no rape allegation, and I can't imagine what kind of evidence is going to come out about that family at trial.

It's typical of abortion proponents to expect every single case of rape prevented (impossible in a fallen world) before even considering the depravity of abortion. But it's deflection. Rape constitutes <0.3% of all procured abortions. >97% are procured for social reasons.
